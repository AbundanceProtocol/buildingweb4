### BUILDING WEB 4.0

Web 4.0 is a revolutionary economic system that turns digital content (articles, videos, open-source code, etc.) into financial assets whose value is based on the credibility and importance of the content.
Web 4.0 leverages existing Web 2 technologies (user interaction) and Web 3 technologies (data security and token programming) to produce a decentralized economy for digital content

Users can also invest tokens in open-source, research and investigative journalism projects (in exchange for a share of the resulting product).
