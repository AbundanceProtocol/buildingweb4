## 🔺 Issue: 

New issue template


## 🔍  Description:

Create a reusable github issue template for assignees to reference to in order to complete a feature creation, bugfix, etc.

This template is a sample that I've created, which can be used for any part of a project. All fields are not required when posting one, but some fields are important for certain issues (i.e. "Create a new button with custom design" should add image references to desktop/mobile versions on Figma)

Checklist should be considered requirements, since it will help to fulfill our end goals and to avoid future bugs as much as possible.

This template can be further customized as necessary.
